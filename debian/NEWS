rsyslog (8.2310.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Enable various systemd sandboxing and security hardening features in
  rsyslog.service.

  The command "systemd-analyze security rsyslog.service" provides an overview
  of the active security and sandboxing settings.

  Should you run a custom setup which is broken by those changes, you can
  disable individual settings by creating a drop-in config file for
  rsyslog.service via "systemctl edit rsyslog.service".

  See also "man capabilities" and "man systemd.exec".

rsyslog (5.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The way rsyslog processes SIGHUP has changed. It no longer does a reload
  of its configuration, but simply closes all open files, which is a much more
  lightweight operation.
  To apply a changed configuration, rsyslogd needs to be restarted now.
  As a consequence, the reload action has been dropped from the init script.

  A new action called "rotate" was added to the init script, which signals
  rsyslogd to close all open files. This new action is used in the rsyslog
  logrotate configuration file.
